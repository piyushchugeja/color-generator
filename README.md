# Random color generator
A Swing based color generating application.

### Color contrast feature
Since the background of the panel keeps changing, it may get difficult for the user to read the hex code for the new color. The contrast solves this problem. A new color is generated which is in contrast with the panel's color and the text color is set to the said color.

### Previous button
In a hurry and accidentally missed the color you wanted? No worries, the previous button is here to save you. You can go back to all the colors you generated.

### Design and use
- It has the simplest design where you can copy the color at one click.
