# Random color generator
A Swing based color generating application.

### The color contrast
Since the background of the panel keeps changing, it may get difficult for the user to read the hex code for the new color. The contrast solves this problem.
A new color is generated which is in contrast with the panel's color and the text color is set to the said color.

### Design and use
- It has the simplest design where you can copy the color at one click.
